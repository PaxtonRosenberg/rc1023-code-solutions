## Questions

1. Who did you interview (name, title, and company)

TJ Kinion - Revive Real Estate

1. Why did you decide to interview this person? What was your intention?

I saw that he used to work at LFZ and is now a recruiter in tech so I thought it would be a good idea to reach out and hear his perspective on the do's and don't's for boot camp grads trying to enter the industry.

1. What did you learn from the interview?

The main takeaways from my conversation with TJ was that communication is very, very important. He mentioned there was importance around sending a timely thank you letter post interview as well as being vocal about progress on any technical challenge problem given, but most of all my takeaway was that it is very important to showcase how you would be to work with if hired. Be polite, ask good questions, communicate and be likeable. Very important to show, especially in a saturated job market.

1. Do you see any opportunities available to you from this interview? If so, what are they?

No direct opportunities, but hopefully TJ will keep me in mind if they have any openings at Revive.

1. What are your next steps if any?

Continue to reach out to others in the field and see if the conversation will lead to a job or at the very least a friend.

1. What would you do differently next time in your approach to informational interviewing?

I don't know if I would do anything differently, I feel I got the value I was looking for from my conversation.
