          You should only move forward with Canvas if an when you have
          determined that <br />
          we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on
          investment. Our <br />
          goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this
          determination one <br />
          way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
          application for <br />
          to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current
          customers to talk <br />
          about their experience.

        <p class="roi-text">
          Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
          community <br />
          resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number,
          enrolling your <br />
          payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab fedd
          running. We&apos;ll <br />
          also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas
          so that <br />
          sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if
          interfaces with health <br />
          information exchanges or other information technology vendors are
          important, we <br />
          will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

        <p class="roi-text">
          The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
          current data, which <br />
          we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise
          EMR <br />
          databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient
          demographics and <br />
          information like medication, problems, and allergies is relatively
          straightforward. <br />
          While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our
          team has <br />
          been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety
          of EMRs.

          We wil work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical
          content, <br />
          charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a
          few weeks <br />
          prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical,
          practice <br />
          management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live,
          one of our <br />
          team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on
          implementation and <br />
          training.

          Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your
          practice. We will be <br />
          with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference,
          to make sure <br />
          everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you
          have a <br />
          handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical
          microtemplates, <br />
          setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings,
          and more. <br />
          We are here to help with it all.
