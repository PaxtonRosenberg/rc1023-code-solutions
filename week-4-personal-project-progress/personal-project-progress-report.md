## Questions

1. What have you completed thus far, and what is still left to complete?

I have started creating a personal portfolio site as well as a project with another student where we were tasked to build a virtual bartender for a company called Suerte Tequila. I also would like to build out a sports card value calculator.

1. What challenges are you facing at this time? What are some resources at your disposal to help you overcome these challenges?

Right now I am having some trouble figuring out how to use the ChatGPT API correctly, but hoping to work through those troubles early next week and then complete my portfolio website.

1. What do you like about your project so far?

Personal Portfolio - I like the design so far, need to figure out deployment

Suerte Tequila - I think the version we created is better than the original, just need to link up the chatgpt API.

1. Is your project on the path towards what you envisioned? Are there any areas of your project that need to be reimagined?

Yes, both are on the right track and are going in the direction I thought they would.

1. Can you outline a realistic timeline for completion?

Personal Portfolio and Suerte Tequila will be done by the end of the week. I think it will take me 2-3 weeks to complete the sports card value calculator.
